🧠 Prediction Techniques in Data Mining
This project is a personal exploration of various machine learning classification techniques using a real-world dataset. It demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of predictive modeling — from data cleaning to performance evaluation — showcasing the power of different algorithms in classification problems.

📌 Objective
To build and evaluate multiple classification models to predict outcomes based on structured data. The project focuses on:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection

Training multiple prediction models

Evaluating and comparing model performance
